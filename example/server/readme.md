## Server Example

Demo of a server using many of the tools luce provides.
* luce/store
* luce/util/lusers
* luce/util/lusers/lusess
* luce/lhttp/tokens
* luce/lhttp/midware
* luce/util/unixsocket

While the server is running it can be accessed over a unixsocket with the
socketclient tool.

I may or may not fill this in more. As it stands, it does demo a lot of useful
functionality. But it could really use a lot more just to make a complete demo.
